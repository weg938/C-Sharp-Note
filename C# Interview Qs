1. What is C#?

    C# (pronounced "See Sharp") is a simple, modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language. 

2. What are the types of comment in C# with examples?

    //, /**/, 
    XML: 
    '///' input_character*, 
    '/**' delimited_comment_section* asterisk+ '/'
    
3. Can multiple catch blocks be executed? (How try and catch works)

    When an exception is thrown, the common language runtime (CLR) looks for the catch statement that handles this exception. 
    If the currently executing method does not contain such a catch block, the CLR looks at the method that called the current method, and so on up the call stack. 
    If no catch block is found, then the CLR displays an unhandled exception message to the user and stops execution of the program.
    
4. What is the difference between public, static and void?
  
    The public keyword is an access modifier for types and type members. 
    Public access is the most permissive access level. 
    There are no restrictions on accessing public members.
    
    Use the static modifier to declare a static member, which belongs to the type itself rather than to a specific object. 
    The static modifier can be used with classes, fields, methods, properties, operators, events, and constructors, 
    but it cannot be used with indexers, finalizers, or types other than classes. 
    
    When used as the return type for a method, void specifies that the method doesn't return a value.
    
5. What is an object?
    
    The object type is an alias for Object in .NET. 
    In the unified type system of C#, all types, predefined and user-defined, reference types and value types, 
    inherit directly or indirectly from Object. 
    You can assign values of any type to variables of type object. 
    When a variable of a value type is converted to object, it is said to be boxed. 
    When a variable of type object is converted to a value type, it is said to be unboxed. 
    
6. Define Constructors?

    Whenever a class or struct is created, its constructor is called. 
    A class or struct may have multiple constructors that take different arguments. 
    Constructors enable the programmer to set default values, limit instantiation, and write code that is flexible and easy to read. 
    
7. What is Jagged Arrays?
    A jagged array is an array whose elements are arrays. 
    The elements of a jagged array can be of different dimensions and sizes. 
    A jagged array is sometimes called an "array of arrays."
