1. What is C#?

3. Can multiple catch blocks be executed? (How try and catch works)

    When an exception is thrown, the common language runtime (CLR) looks for the catch statement that handles this exception. 
    If the currently executing method does not contain such a catch block, the CLR looks at the method that called the current method, and so on up the call stack. 
    If no catch block is found, then the CLR displays an unhandled exception message to the user and stops execution of the program.
    
4. What is the difference between public, static and void?
  
    The public keyword is an access modifier for types and type members. 
    Public access is the most permissive access level. 
    There are no restrictions on accessing public members.
    
    Use the static modifier to declare a static member, which belongs to the type itself rather than to a specific object. 
    The static modifier can be used with classes, fields, methods, properties, operators, events, and constructors, 
    but it cannot be used with indexers, finalizers, or types other than classes. 
    
    When used as the return type for a method, void specifies that the method doesn't return a value.
